# CSS calc() Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with the CSS `calc()` function when combining percentage and pixel units, particularly within nested elements.  The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, resulting in unexpected layout.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.css`, addresses the issue by restructuring the CSS to avoid the problematic combination or using alternative approaches to achieve the same layout.
