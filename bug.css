The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentages and other units.  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not produce the intended result, potentially leading to unexpected layout issues.  This might be due to how the browser parses and calculates the expression, specifically when dealing with mixed units.  Another uncommon issue is unexpected behavior when using `calc()` within a nested context, where the parent element's dimensions might influence the result in an unforeseen way.
